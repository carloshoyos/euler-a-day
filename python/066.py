"""
Project Euler Problem 66
========================

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

                              x^2 - Dy^2 = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 649^2 - 13 * 180^2 =
1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D
is square.

By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the
following:

3^2 - 2 * 2^2 = 1
2^2 - 3 * 1^2 = 1
9^2 - 5 * 4^2 = 1
5^2 - 6 * 2^2 = 1
8^2 - 7 * 3^2 = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D 7, the largest x is
obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest
value of x is obtained.

# Diophantine equations and number theory are like chess.  You can understand the basics quickly, but it takes so much to be good once you start unraveling the connections with complex areas of math. 
# Case in point, the equation above is known as Pell's equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation 
# I spent over a week learning and researching this.  Mathworld was a great resource on pell's equation: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PellEquation.html

# There is a bonkers theorem that connects the solution of Pell's equation with the convergentes of continued fractions (WOW!): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation#Fundamental_solution_via_continued_fractions
