Project Euler Problem 28
========================

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise
direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

                              21 22 23 24 25
                              20  7  8  9 10
                              19  6  1  2 11
                              18  5  4  3 12
                              17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of both diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of both diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the
same way?

# two approaches:  
#  1- brute force, calculate the spiral in a 2d array. 
#  2- look for a pattern.  You can calculate the sum of the outer ring once you see the top right corner is  nË†2.

# The top right corrner is n^2  (proof by induction, to go from n to n+1  you add 4 times n+1 (for each of the sides). So the n+1 corner is n^2 + 4*(n+1) == (n+1)^2 )
# going clock wise, the previos corners are:  n^2-n+1,  n^2-2n+2 and n^2-3n+3   
# adding all up, you get 4n^2 -6n + 6
